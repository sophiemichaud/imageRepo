# README
This is my submission for the Shopify Developper Intern Challenge Question!

Here is a direct link to my [Picto Vault](https://picto-vault.herokuapp.com/) application.

# Background
Before beginning this project I decided to do a bit of research on some popular online image repositories and their features. Some examples of these websites include:

- https://www.alamy.com/
- https://www.gettyimages.com/

I also took inspiration for this project from a Shopify blog post written by Braveen Kumar: https://www.shopify.ca/blog/how-to-sell-photos-online. This blog post provided me with a super helpful insight into the basics of selling/buying images online.

# Specifications
I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to teach myself something new so I chose to create this project as a Rails web application. 

I used a Postgresql database, Microsoft Azure for storage, and I hosted the application on Heroku.
