# README
This is my submission for the Shopify Developper Intern Challenge Question!

Here is a direct link to my [Picto Vault](https://picto-vault.herokuapp.com/) application hosted on Heroku.

# Background
Before beginning this project I decided to do a bit of research on some popular online image repositories and their features. Some examples of these websites include:

- https://www.alamy.com/
- https://www.gettyimages.com/

I also took inspiration for this project from a Shopify blog post written by Braveen Kumar: https://www.shopify.ca/blog/how-to-sell-photos-online. This blog post provided me with some super helpful insight into the basics of selling/buying images online that I was able to apply when designing my application.

# Specifications
I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to learn some new skills. For this reason, I challenged myself to build this application using Ruby on Rails!  

- Database: Postgresql
- Storage: Microsoft Azure
- Hosting: Heroku
- Styling: Bootstrap
